What's going on guys, Zack Pace here and I want to talk a little about myself. Second semester of my 2nd year at Sonoma State, only 4 more weeks left and time is only going faster everyday. The one thing I've been doing this year is taking each day at a time. I would often freak myself out with the task I had to accomplish, but that only makes the situation worse. 

Anyway, Excited as heck for the summer and I'll begin a project with Ian to stay up to date with my coding abilities. The Fall of 2017 is going to be a wild one.

President Trump needs to realize that he's not running a business and nobody in the Federal Government is going to let him pass any executive orders that are obscene and inhumaine. Violence is not a form of action we should tolerate when it comes to foreign affairs, as well as violence between government and citizens of America. 

Can I have some Tacos please, I'm starving.
